# Mini-Projects

This is a repositary containg all the mini projects that I have made using the languages that I have learned from. 
Currently it has only Python and C++ and will increase with more langugages that I learn.

### Hangman.py ###

    :  ### This is a simple game very similar to the tradtional game which I have tried 
    implementating using Python ###

### TikTaktoe.cpp ###

    :  ### Tiktaktoe game to play against your friends. Basic level game and functionality ###


### Monty_Hall.py ###

    :  ### This is a program proving the tricky question of monty hall. 
    
    The question is Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? 
    
    The answer is that swtching helps you and that too a high chane of 66% of the times. So even though I convinved my friend mathametically why this is true to make matters intresting I wrote a python code to simulate the game 1000 times and showed it to be 66% again.
